This is SCOMP, the Spreadsheet COMPiler.

scomp is a research tool that reads machine-readable results files from
simulations and combines them in programmable ways (with user-specified
formulas) to produce spreadsheets and plots as output. It was written with
computer architecture research in mind (in which a ``run'' consists of several
simulator knob configurations run with a common set of benchmarks), though it
may be useful in other, as-yet-unforeseen, ways as well.

More documentation is coming! For now, the source and sample scompfiles will have to do.

scomp is released under the GNU GPL, version 2 only. It is copyright (c)
